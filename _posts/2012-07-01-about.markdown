Iâ€™m an Engineering Leader with 8+ YoE in professional software development and 2+ YoE of managing teams of software and infrastructure engineers as well as data scientists. I previously held the title of Head of Engineering of a Series C startup, where at one point I was managing up to 20 engineers, including ICs and managers.

I have a track record of building core customer-facing products, operating high-scale distributed systems, and developing high-performing teams.

I have a strong background in backend and distributed systems, including a PhD in Network Security and 7+ YoE in pan-european research projects, and I am the author of several international research papers, patents in network performance monitoring and search relevancy, and two books on network attack injection.
