  [LASIGE](https://ciencias.ulisboa.pt/en/lasige-large-scale-informatics-systems-laboratory) is a research unit of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (DI) of the University of Lisbon (ULisboa), Faculty of Sciences (FCUL).
  It develops activities in a number of relevant areas of computer science and engineering (CSE), including: Security and dependability (Navigators Group).

  As a **Researcher** I have worked for the Navigators Group at LASIGE on Network Security and Dependibility. I have over seven years of experience in pan-european research projects, and I am the author of several international research papers, patents in network performance monitoring and search relevancy, and two books on network attack injection.
