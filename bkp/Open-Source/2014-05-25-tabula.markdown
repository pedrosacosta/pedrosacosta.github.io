  A Google Chrome Extension that replaces New Tab with a beautiful TODO list.

  I've started this project to learn a bit of frontend programming (javascript, css, angularjs) and because I wanted a nice TODO list manager. I was inspired by the beautiful design ans simplistic approch of the chrome extension Momentum. However, I wanted a more complete TODO manager, in particular the ability to log finished TODO items--a sort of personal tracking system.
