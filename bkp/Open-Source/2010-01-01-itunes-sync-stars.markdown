  This Applescript allows iTunes to sync ratings to a local file. You can then publish this file across different computers to synchronize ratings with other iTunes libraries. I suggest some sync file service such as Dropbox in order to have the ratings file instantaneously in sync.
  Then, all you have to do is run this script from time to time from iTunes and it will automatically synchronize your song ratings.
