        <p>Pedro Costa has a Ph.D. in Informatics Engineering at the Faculty of Sciences, University of Lisbon, with distinction and praise. During the Ph.D., he focused on improving Hadoop MapReduce's dependability to tolerate arbitrary faults, malicious faults, and cloud outages in a multi-cloud environment. With this work, he published several scientific articles in relevant conferences and journals. He won two best paper awards and an award of merit to recognize the work developed in the Ph.D.</p>
        
        <p>Currently, he is working as a Senior Researcher in IoT Innovation Lab at Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts, where it focuses on IoT, Industry 4.0, Distributed Systems, and Digital Twins. Previously, he has worked as a researcher in academia, where he participated in two European projects, and as a software engineer where he developed several solutions in the telecommunications area.</p>
        
        <p>His research focuses on dependability in distributed systems in the context of different applications like cloud/edge computing, IoT, and Digital Twins. He is particularly interested in the fault/intrusion tolerance approach, in which systems have to continue to operate correctly irrespectively of the occurrence of faults, attacks, and intrusions.</p>
        
        <p>Pedro Costa has solid experience in industry and research for 16 years, attested by contributing to the design of several industrial fault-tolerant and secure telecommunication systems and breakthrough research projects. He also assumed positions to transfer knowledge about new technologies and has worked in stressful and demanding environments. He is a person with great motivation, research interest (theoretical and practical), a leader, and someone that likes to be challenged with new research problems. He is a member of IEEE, ACM.</p>
